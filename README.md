An Android barcode book reader app which I took from Udacity - Advanced Android App Development cource to get to the production level.

I decided to implement Google SignIn in here, so your favorite books now are backed by Google Books service https://books.google.com/.
You can search a book with title, ISBN or Scan Barcode with camera,
which I implemented using the Google Vision API https://developers.google.com/vision/?hl=en.
I took Barcode reader code from this sample https://goo.gl/KGGtEy
